# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is the Keno Prediction Tool?

The Keno Prediction Tool is a comprehensive software package for analyzing Keno game data, identifying patterns, making predictions, and tracking prediction accuracy. It helps users apply statistical and machine learning techniques to Keno data for educational purposes and potential game play optimization.

### Is Keno Prediction Tool guaranteed to help me win?

No. The Keno Prediction Tool is primarily an educational and analytical tool. While it may help identify patterns that could improve your odds slightly, Keno remains a game of chance, and no prediction system can guarantee wins. The tool's value lies in its analytical capabilities and the insights it provides about probability and pattern recognition.

### Is using the Keno Prediction Tool legal?

Yes. The tool only analyzes publicly available data and makes predictions based on pattern recognition. It does not manipulate the game or exploit any vulnerabilities. However, always check the specific rules of your local Keno provider or casino.

### What data sources does the tool support?

The tool can scrape data from several sources:
- BCLC (British Columbia Lottery Corporation)
- Sample data included with the tool
- Custom URLs (if properly formatted)
- CSV files with historical data

### How much data do I need for accurate predictions?

For basic analysis, at least 100 draws are recommended. For more advanced methods:
- Standard statistical methods: 200+ draws
- Machine learning methods: 300+ draws
- Deep learning methods: 500+ draws

More data generally leads to more reliable patterns and predictions.

## Technical Questions

### What Python version is required?

The Keno Prediction Tool requires Python 3.8 or higher. Some advanced features (like deep learning) may require additional dependencies.

### How do I install the required dependencies?

Most dependencies will be installed automatically when you install the package:

```bash
pip install keno-prediction-tool
```

For advanced features (deep learning), you may need to install additional packages:

```bash
pip install keno-prediction-tool[full]
```

### Can I use the tool without installing it?

Yes, you can clone the repository and run the code directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keno-prediction-tool.git
cd keno-prediction-tool
python -m pip install -e .
```

However, installation via pip is recommended for most users.

### Does the tool work on all operating systems?

Yes, the Keno Prediction Tool is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux, as long as you have Python 3.8+ installed.

## Analysis Questions

### What types of patterns does the tool look for?

The tool analyzes several types of patterns:

1. **Frequency patterns**: How often each number appears
2. **Pair relationships**: Which numbers tend to appear together
3. **Skip and hit patterns**: Intervals between appearances of each number
4. **Cyclic patterns**: Regular intervals in number appearances
5. **Statistical patterns**: Even/odd ratios, high/low distributions, sums, etc.
6. **Complex patterns**: Using machine learning to detect patterns humans might miss

### How does the tool handle randomness in Keno?

The tool acknowledges that Keno is primarily random but looks for slight deviations from perfect randomness. It uses statistical significance testing to distinguish between genuine patterns and random fluctuations. The validation system helps verify which methods perform better than random chance over time.

### Why do pattern analysis results change over time?

Patterns in Keno data may evolve over time due to:
1. Random fluctuations (most common reason)
2. Changes in drawing equipment or procedures
3. Actual non-random factors (rare)

The tool's tracking system helps identify which changes are significant and which are just noise.

### How does the "due theory" work?

The "due theory" analyzes how long it's been since each number appeared compared to its average frequency. Numbers that have been absent longer than usual are considered "overdue." While this doesn't guarantee these numbers will appear soon (a common misconception known as the gambler's fallacy), some studies suggest overdue numbers may have slightly different appearance rates in some Keno systems.

## Prediction Questions

### Which prediction method is the best?

There's no single "best" method for all scenarios. The ensemble method often performs well because it combines insights from multiple approaches. However, the validation system allows you to track which methods work best for your specific data source and preferences.

### How many numbers should I pick?

The optimal number of picks depends on:
1. The Keno variant you're playing
2. Your risk tolerance
3. The payout structure

Use the `compare_play_types()` function to calculate the expected value for different pick sizes:

```python
analyzer.compare_play_types("BCLC")
```

### How accurate are the predictions?

For a typical Pick 4 strategy:
- Random chance would give about 25% accuracy (1 match)
- Good prediction methods might achieve 30-35% accuracy
- The best methods might reach 35-40% in some cases

Remember that even small improvements over random chance can be significant if statistically valid.

### Why doesn't the tool predict all 20 numbers?

The tool focuses on predicting a smaller set of numbers (typically 4-10) because:
1. Most Keno players select a limited number of spots
2. Predicting all 20 numbers accurately is extremely difficult
3. The strategy involves finding a small set of numbers with better-than-random odds

### How often should I change my numbers?

This depends on your strategy:
1. **Hot number strategy**: Update frequently (every 5-10 draws)
2. **Cyclic pattern strategy**: Update based on the detected cycles
3. **Ensemble strategy**: Reevaluate after 20-30 draws

The validation system can help you determine the optimal frequency for updating your numbers.

## Validation Questions

### Why is validation important?

Validation provides objective evidence of which prediction methods actually work better than random chance. Without validation, it's easy to be misled by coincidental patterns or selective memory (remembering hits and forgetting misses).

### How does the tool calculate statistical significance?

The tool uses statistical hypothesis testing to calculate p-values. The null hypothesis is that the prediction method performs no better than random selection. A p-value below 0.05 indicates a 95% confidence that the method's performance is not due to random chance.

### What does "statistically significant" mean?

"Statistically significant" means that a result is unlikely to have occurred by random chance alone. In the context of Keno prediction, it means that a method's performance is likely due to genuine pattern detection rather than luck.

### How many validations do I need for reliable results?

At least 30 validations are needed for basic statistical validity, but 100+ validations provide more reliable conclusions. More validations reduce the impact of random fluctuations and provide stronger evidence.

## Strategy Questions

### How can I optimize my Keno strategy?

1. **Use the expected value calculations**: `analyzer.compare_play_types("BCLC")`
2. **Simulate different strategies**: `analyzer.simulate_strategy()`
3. **Track performance with validation**: Use the ValidationTracker
4. **Adjust based on evidence**: Focus on methods with statistical significance

The key is to make decisions based on data and statistical evidence rather than intuition or short-term results.

### Should I play the same numbers every time?

There's no definitive answer, but:
- Playing the same numbers makes it easier to track performance
- Updating numbers based on new analysis may capture evolving patterns
- A hybrid approach where you keep some numbers constant and vary others can be effective

The validation system can help you compare these approaches.

### How should I interpret the expected value calculations?

The expected value (EV) represents your mathematical expectation per dollar bet:
- EV < 0: You expect to lose money long-term (typical for all casino games)
- Higher EV = Better play type (less disadvantageous)
- EV calculations help you find the least disadvantageous play types

For example, if Pick 4 has an EV of -0.30 and Pick 10 has an EV of -0.40, Pick 4 is mathematically better in the long run.

### What's the best bankroll management strategy?

Consider these principles:
1. **Only play with money you can afford to lose**
2. **Set strict loss limits** (e.g., 5% of bankroll per session)
3. **Consider the Kelly criterion** for optimal bet sizing
4. **Match your strategy to your bankroll** (larger bankrolls can handle more variance)

Remember that even optimized strategies have negative expected value in the long run.

## Visualization Questions

### What visualizations are most helpful?

Different visualizations serve different purposes:
- **Frequency heatmap**: Overall distribution of number appearances
- **Overdue numbers chart**: Identifies numbers that may be "due"
- **Cyclic patterns chart**: Helps identify periodic patterns
- **Prediction comparison**: Shows agreement/disagreement between methods
- **Strategy performance**: Compares ROI of different approaches

The comprehensive dashboard combines all these visualizations.

### How do I interpret the frequency heatmap?

The frequency heatmap shows:
- **Color intensity**: More frequent numbers have darker colors
- **Number arrangement**: Numbers are arranged in their traditional 8x10 grid
- **Patterns**: Look for clusters or patterns in the distribution

Perfect randomness would show a uniform distribution; significant deviations may indicate patterns.

### What should I look for in the cyclic patterns chart?

Pay attention to:
- **Confidence level**: Higher confidence suggests more reliable cycles
- **Next expected appearance**: When a number is next predicted to appear
- **Cycle length**: Shorter cycles provide more frequent opportunities

Numbers with high confidence and consistent cycles are potentially more predictable.

## Command Line Interface Questions

### How do I use the CLI for daily predictions?

Here's a simple daily workflow:

```bash
# Update data
keno data scrape --source bclc --output daily_data.csv

# Generate predictions
keno predict --data daily_data.csv --method ensemble --picks 4 --output predictions.json

# Create visualizations
keno visualize --data daily_data.csv --dashboard --dashboard-file daily_dashboard.pdf
```

You can automate this with a scheduled script.

### Can I automate the validation process?

Yes, you can create a script that:
1. Records predictions before each draw
2. Validates against results after each draw
3. Periodically analyzes performance

Example script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Record predictions
keno predict --method ensemble --picks 4 --output predictions.json
PRED_NUMBERS=$(jq -r '.predictions.ensemble | join(",")' predictions.json)
keno validate record --method ensemble --numbers $PRED_NUMBERS --draw-id $(date +%Y%m%d)

# After the draw, run:
# keno validate check --id [ID] --actual [ACTUAL_NUMBERS]
```

### How can I compare multiple methods with the CLI?

Use the comparison features:

```bash
# Compare prediction methods
keno predict --compare --picks 4 --output comparison.json

# Compare method performance with validation
keno validate compare --picks 4 --draws 100 --plot comparison.png
```

### Can I export results in different formats?

Yes, the CLI supports various output formats:

```bash
# JSON output
keno analyze --type frequency --json > frequency.json

# YAML output
keno analyze --type frequency --yaml > frequency.yaml

# CSV output (for certain commands)
keno validate performance --output performance.csv
```

## Advanced Questions

### Can I create custom prediction methods?

Yes, you can extend the KenoAnalyzer class to add your own methods:

```python
class CustomAnalyzer(KenoAnalyzer):
    def predict_using_custom_method(self, num_picks=4):
        # Your custom prediction logic here
        return predicted_numbers
```

### How can I integrate the tool with other systems?

The Python API makes integration straightforward:
- **Websites**: Create a Flask/Django app that uses the analyzer
- **Mobile apps**: Use as a backend service
- **Notification systems**: Send predictions via email/SMS
- **Databases**: Store results in SQL/NoSQL databases

Example of email integration:

```python
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage

def send_predictions(predictions, email):
    msg = EmailMessage()
    msg.set_content(f"Today's predictions: {predictions}")
    msg['Subject'] = 'Keno Predictions'
    msg['From'] = 'your-email@example.com'
    msg['To'] = email
    
    s = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com')
    s.send_message(msg)
    s.quit()
```

### How does the deep learning prediction work?

The deep learning system:
1. Converts historical draws into feature matrices
2. Trains neural networks (LSTM, CNN) on these sequences
3. Recognizes complex patterns that traditional methods might miss
4. Combines predictions from multiple model architectures

It requires more data (300+ draws) but can detect subtle patterns in some cases.

### Is the tool suitable for other lottery games?

While focused on Keno, many of the analysis techniques can be adapted for:
- Pick 3/Pick 4 games
- Traditional lotteries (with modifications)
- Other games with numerical draws

However, you would need to modify the code to handle different game structures.

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Why am I getting errors when scraping data?

Common causes:
1. **Internet connection issues**
2. **Website changes** (the scraper may need updating)
3. **Rate limiting** (trying to scrape too quickly)
4. **Proxy/firewall restrictions**

Try using the sample data or a different source while troubleshooting.

### Why do machine learning methods fail?

Possible reasons:
1. **Insufficient data** (need 200+ draws)
2. **Missing dependencies** (TensorFlow not installed)
3. **Memory limitations** (try reducing data size)
4. **Version incompatibilities**

Start with simpler methods and add ML gradually.

### How do I fix database errors in validation?
